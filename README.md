#Problem Statement
The Phonepe Pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data, process it, and present it in an interactive dashboard for easy exploration and visualization.

#Approach
Data Extraction: The Github repository will be cloned using scripting to fetch the data and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.
Data Transformation: Python and Pandas will be used to manipulate and pre-process the data, including cleaning and handling missing values.
Database Insertion: The transformed data will be stored in a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
Dashboard Creation: Streamlit and Plotly will be utilized to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures.
Data Retrieval: The data from the MySQL database will be fetched into a Pandas dataframe and used to update the dashboard dynamically.
Deployment: The solution will be thoroughly tested and deployed publicly to ensure secure, efficient, and user-friendly access.
